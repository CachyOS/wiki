CachyOS can be installed via two types of installers. The net installer or the semi-offline installer.

# Net Installer
The net installer ISO is about 700MB in size. All packages during installation will be downloaded from the Internet. Both the net and the semi-offline installers need internet connectivity for installation.

# Semi-offline Installer
The semi-offline ISO is about 2GB in size. It contains about half of the packages that are needed for KDE installation, hence the name semi. It will download any missing or out dated packages from the Internet. Semi-offline installer also need internet connectivity. The benefit of having many packages in the ISO is to make the installation process faster. Most of the packages are already cached in the ISO and will be installed directly from the ISO to the target device. If you have a week internet connectivity then we suggest you use semi-offline installer.

# ISOs Link
You can find list of CachyOS ISOs in [sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cachyos-arch/files/). Both net and semi-offline installers are listed.
