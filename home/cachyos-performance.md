# Linux Kernel with BORE scheduler is the default choice

Yes, this is a part of the optimization for CachyOS. Â¿Why do we use that scheduler in particular?. Well... let us explain why!. There are so many schedulers like BMQ, MuQSS, that some of you might already know (or not), but we have tested BORE and it resulted the one with the best performance results both in benchmarks and responsiveness tests.

> Disclaimer: Although for some it would result in a better performance overall with the BORE scheduler, it also depends on your type of hardware.

# Huge repository with packages compiled with generic-v3

You probably don't know so much about compiling and stuff, let me introduce you to it. You can compile code in so many different ways, with custom flags, toolchains, algorithms and so on, we barely use the same as Arch Linux, but here is one big change to consider, the x86-64 architecture is supported by every Intel/AMD processor but as technology rapidly changed and improvements were discovered, new instructions were created and used to support better features, improved reliability at runtime, more stable code and so on. Below we'll show you all of them and what instructions are required for them to work.

These are the four x86-64 microarchitecture levels on top of the x86-64 baseline: 
- x86-64: CMOV, CMPXCHG8B, FPU, FXSR, MMX, FXSR, SCE, SSE, SSE2 
- x86-64-v2: (close to Nehalem) CMPXCHG16B, LAHF-SAHF, POPCNT, SSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, SSSE3 
- x86-64-v3: (close to Haswell) AVX, AVX2, BMI1, BMI2, F16C, FMA, LZCNT, MOVBE, XSAVE 
- x86-64-v4: AVX512F, AVX512BW, AVX512CD, AVX512DQ, AVX512VL

**For more educated people in the tech:**

We can refer to them as a group of instruction sets; most Linux distributions use x86-64-v2 or vanilla x86-64 for compatibility with older hardware, but this may limit performance on newer hardware. You most likely have something newer than a Haswell CPU, also known as an Intel 4th generation CPU; if so, enjoy the free performance! These days (2022) all newer processors have many more instructions than x86-64-v2, but you can't use them because packages compiled with x86-64 and v2 can't use your CPU's full potential, and the performance improvement could range from 10% to 35% in some cases.

**For users with less tech knowledge:** 

Example: Suppose you have a laptop with an AMD Ryzen 5 4500U or an Intel Core i5 1035G4, and your friend has a desktop with an Intel Core i7-9700K. Both machines have a CPU that supports the AVX instruction set, but your programs cannot use it, resulting in lower performance and capability.

# Here is a reason why most Linux distros still use x86-64

Because there are still a lot of linux servers with old hardware around the world, it makes sense for Linux to be more friendly for end users and not exclude those who don't have the privilege or money to have new and shiny hardware. However most personal computers and laptops nowadays already include a CPU with all of the necessary instruction sets in the x86-64-v3 level; this is also one of the many reasons why CachyOS exists and could potentially unlock even more performance on your PC.

I know... so many buzz-words is bad without proof, so here is a doc testing and benchmarking x86-v64 VS x86-64-v3.

<https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2021-March/048739.html>

**So all packages and kernels in the CachyOS (x86-64-v3) repositories have around 10% performance uplift and some packages can have higher performance uplift (15% or 36%!)**

# Benchmarks

Phoronix did benchmarked CachyOS against other Distros. 
https://www.phoronix.com/review/cachyos-linux-perf

In the PHP and python benchmark we had a little regression, which was caused that ananicy-cpp has limited PHP. This was fixed with the following commit https://github.com/CachyOS/ananicy-rules/commit/9e0d00ef1ad5866b1b597b1e0af7e1ce3ee985ee .
We are going to improve the python situation as soon we will update to Python 3.11.
We are looking really forward for further benchmarks.
Thanks to the great work from phoronix.
