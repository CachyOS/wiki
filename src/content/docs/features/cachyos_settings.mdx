Alongside our optimized kernels and repositories, we also provide settings that further improve the desktop experience.
We also bundle in some helper scripts to for QoL improvements. All these configurations and scripts are under the `cachyos-settings` package.

## sysctl Tweaks

We provide a lot of sysctl tweaks that aims to improve overall desktop performance. Each sysctl entry is documented
well in the file [`99-cachyos-settings.conf`](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/lib/sysctl.d/99-cachyos-settings.conf)

To make changes to any of these values, copy the original entry and make a new file under `/etc/sysctl.d/` for the modified value.

### Modifying sysctl values

<Steps>

1. Take a look at the original value from `cachyos-settings`

    ```sh
    ❯ cat /usr/lib/sysctl.d/99-cachyos-settings.conf
    # Only experimental!
    # Let Realtime tasks run as long they need
    # sched: RT throttling activated
    kernel.sched_rt_runtime_us=-1
    ```

2. Make a new file in `/etc/sysctl.d` to make changes to the sysctl settings

    ```sh title="Reverting kernel.sched_rt_runtime_us= to its default value"
    ❯ sudo micro /etc/sysctl.d/99-kerel-sched-rt.conf # If the file doesn't exist, this command creates and lets you edit the file
    kernel.sched_rt_runtime_us=950000
    ```

</Steps>

## udev Rules

- [ZRAM Rules](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/30-zram.rules) - Sets ZRAM swappiness to a more aggressive
value so cache is more likely to swap to ZRAM
- [HPET Permissions](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/40-hpet-permissions.rules) - Allows access to `rtc0`
and `hpet` device nodes by the audio group.
- [SATA Power Management](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/50-sata.rules) - Sets power management policy of SATA devices to `max_performance`
- [I/O Scheduler Rules](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/60-ioschedulers.rules) - Selects the optimal scheduler for each drive type (HDD, SSD, NVME)
- [hdparm Rules](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/69-hdparm.rules) - Sets SATA and IDE HDDs to maximum performance
- [NVIDIA RTD3](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/71-nvidia.rules) - Configures dynamic power management functionality for the Turing GPU generation. **RTD3 does not work properly on Turing GPUs with the open modules**
- [CPU DMA Latency](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/99-cpu-dma-latency.rules) -
Allows access to the `cpu_dma_latency` device node by the audio group.
- [NTSync](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/99-ntsync.rules) - Allows `ntsync` to be accessed by user-space
applications

## modprobe Options

- Forces AMDGPU driver on Southern Islands (GCN 1.0) and Sea Islands (GCN 2.0)
- Enable [various tweaks](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/lib/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf) for NVIDIA
- Blacklist watchdog modules

## Helper Scripts

- **`amdpstate-guided`** - Sets the `amd-pstate` scaling driver to `guided` and switches the CPU governor to `schedutil`
- **`cachyos-bugreport.sh`** - Collects various logs from `inxi`, `dmesg` and `journalctl` to aid in troubleshooting
- **`game-performance`** - Wrapper script for `powerprofilesctl` to switch to performance profile on-demand.
See [Power Profile Switching On Demand](/configuration/gaming#power-profile-switching-on-demand)
- **`kerver`** - QoL script to show information about the current kernel
- **`ksmctl`** - Utility to enable merging same memory pages into one for better performance and lower memory usage. **Adds a signifact CPU overhead**

- **`ksmstats`** - Shows general savings from Kernel Samepage Merging
- **`paste-cachyos`** - Script to paste terminal output for text files from the system

    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="Uploading text files">
            ```sh
            ❯ paste-cachyos /path/to/file

- [`pci-latency`](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/bin/pci-latency)
    ```sh title="Enabling pci-latency systemwide"
    ❯ sudo systemctl enable --now pci-latency.service
    ```
- **`sbctl-batch-sign`** - Helper script to easily sign kernel images and EFI binaries for secure boot and saves them to sbctl's
database
- **`topmem`** - Shows up to 10 processes which are currently using the highest amount of RAM in a descending order


## Other configurations

- Disable zswap
- Increase highest requested RTC interrupt frequency to **3072**
- Set Transparent Hugepage Defrag to `defer+madvise`
- [ananicy-cpp](https://gitlab.com/ananicy-cpp/ananicy-cpp) with [community-maintained rulesets](https://github.com/CachyOS/ananicy-rules)
- [ZRAM Generator](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/lib/systemd/zram-generator.conf) - Sets ZRAM to the same size as RAM and use ZSTD for compression
