## Creating a Bootable CachyOS USB Drive

There are several tools that you can use to create a bootable USB drive of CachyOS. The USB drive must be at least 8GB of size.

### Balena Etcher

<Steps>

1. Download [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/). Balena Etcher supports all 3 Linux, MacOS and Windows.

   If you download the `.AppImage` file, assign executable permission by `chmod +x balenaEtcher-<version>-<arch>.AppImage` and run it by `./balenaEtcher-<version>-<arch>.AppImage`.

2. Plug in your USB drive to your system.
3. Click **Flash from file** and select the CachyOS ISO image file.
4. Click **Select target** and choose the label of your plugged USB drive.
5. Click **Flash** for starting the process.

</Steps>

:::note
You could be asked for administration privileges, so insert credentials and press **Authenticate**.

At the end of flash process you will get a **Flash Completed!** message. Close Balena Etcher and reboot the system for booting into CachyOS.
:::note
Be sure to have the USB drive **boot priority** over other drives in the BIOS.

### Command Line Interface

<Steps>

1. Plug your USB drive into your available USB port.
2. Detect the drive device label of the plugged USB drive by `sudo fdisk -l` (i.e., it could be `/dev/sdX` where `X` is `a`, `b`, and so on) on Linux
and `diskutil list` on MacOS (`/dev/diskY` where `Y` is 0, 1 and so on).
3. Run `sudo dd bs=4M if=full_iso_name.iso of=/dev/<usbdrive> status=progress oflag=sync` (replace `<usbdrive>` by the drive device label of your plugged USB drive).

</Steps>

`dd` command will now copy the contents of the ISO file over to your USB drive. Once done, youâ€™re ready to use the USB drive as CachyOS installation media. Reboot the system to boot into CachyOS.
:::note
Be sure to have the USB drive **boot priority** over other drives in the BIOS.

</Steps>

### Ventoy
