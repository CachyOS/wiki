import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

CachyOS provides an Edition for handheld devices, like the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and Legion Go. This Edition offers a SteamOS-like experience with Game Mode Switching, pre-installed Gaming Applications, and more.

The Handheld Edition employs the LAVD scheduler as the default CPU scheduler, optimized for handheld devices. This results in improved frame rates and battery life during gaming.

The Handheld Edition uses `systemd-boot` as the boot manager. Boot manager selection is not available
as opposed to the default CachyOS ISO. This is intended to simplify the installation process.
