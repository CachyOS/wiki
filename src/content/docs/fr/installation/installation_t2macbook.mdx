## Installation

### General Information

CachyOS provides out of the box support for the T2 MacBook. The required kernel patches are shipped in all the kernels we provide.

**WiFi connection** is **not available** out of the box because it is a closed source firmware, which we are not allowed to redistribute.
The installation will only work with a LAN connection. WiFi support can be set-up after the installation.
See [installation of the firmware](#installation-of-the-firmware)

### Proceeding with Installation

Follow the instructions in [Installation Prepare](/installation/installation_prepare#creating-a-bootable-cachyos-usb-drive) on how to download
the ISO and create a bootable USB drive.

Refer to [Installation on Root](/installation/installation_on_root) after creating a bootable USB drive.
CachyOS applies necessary boot parameters and configurations to your T2 MacBook with CachyOS Hardware Detection.

### Installation of the Firmware

The firmware can be downloaded and fetched from another mirror, which is not hosted by us.

Run the following commands after you have booted into the installed system:

<Steps>

1. Fetch firmware package using one of the following utils:

    <Tabs>

    <TabItem label="using curl">

    ```sh
    curl https://mirror.funami.tech/arch-mact2/os/x86_64/apple-bcm-firmware-14.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst -o apple-bcm-firmware-14.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="using wget">

    ```sh
    wget https://mirror.funami.tech/arch-mact2/os/x86_64/apple-bcm-firmware-14.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
    ```
    > If you don't have `wget`, install it with `sudo pacman -S wget`

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Install firmware package
    ```sh
    sudo pacman -U apple-bcm-firmware-14.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
    ```

</Steps>

After that modprobe the firmware and reload the wifi driver:
```bash
sudo modprobe -r brcmfmac_wcc
sudo modprobe -r brcmfmac
sudo modprobe brcmfmac
```

You are also able to extract the firmware from an ISPW File, see the T2 Wiki:
