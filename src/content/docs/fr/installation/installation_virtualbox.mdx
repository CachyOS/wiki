The following section will guide you through the steps to install CachyOS on VirtualBox.

## Download the latest ISO

Download latest CachyOS ISO as described in [Downloading CachyOS](/cachyos_basic/download/).

## Creating a Virtual Machine

The following section assumes you have VirtualBox installed on your system and set up correctly (including the guest additions and dkms modules if applicable).

<Steps>

1. Open VirtualBox and click on the `New` button.

2. Enter a name for the virtual machine, specify the ISO file you downloaded earlier, and for the type, select `Linux` and `Arch Linux (64-bit)`.

3. Set the processor count to the number of physical cores in your machine (so for 8C/16T machine you should pick 8 in the processor count, you can increase or decrease it according to your setup), Set the memory size to at least 4GB. This is the minimum recommended memory size for CachyOS. If you have more memory available, you can allocate more to the virtual machine to improve performance. Also make sure to enable the `Enable EFI (special OSes only)` option.
    :::caution[WARNING]
    Don't forget to enable the `Enable EFI (special OSes only)` option. This is required for CachyOS to boot correctly.

4. For disk space, allocate at least 32GB of space. You can allocate more if you have the space available. You can optionally choose to pre-allocate the disk space to improve performance.

</Steps>

## Installing CachyOS

<Steps>

1. Start the virtual machine by clicking on the `Start` button.
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import("~/assets/images/virtualbox-vm-start.png")} alt="Starting Virtual Machine" />

2. Now you can follow the steps in the [Installation Guide](/installation/installation_on_root/) to install CachyOS on the virtual machine.

</Steps>

## Optional Tweaks

### Enabling 3D Acceleration

To enable 3D acceleration in VirtualBox, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Shut down the virtual machine if it's running.

2. Click on the `Settings` button.
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import("~/assets/images/virtualbox-vm-settings.png")} alt="Virtual Machine Settings" />

3. Go to the `Display` tab and enable `3D Acceleration` and set the `Video Memory` to 128MB (or whatever is the maximum available).
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import("~/assets/images/virtualbox-vm-3d-acceleration.png")} alt="Enabling 3D Acceleration" />

4. Click on `OK` to save the settings.

5. Start the virtual machine and you should now have 3D acceleration enabled (if the guest additions are installed).

</Steps>
