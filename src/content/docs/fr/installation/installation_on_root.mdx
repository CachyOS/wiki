CachyOS provides several ways to install the system.
The "Erase Disk" Option in Calamares will wipe the selected disk and install then CachyOS to the target.

<Steps>

1. Boot into the ISO and click the **Launch Installer** Button

2. Choose between the **Bootloader** you want to use, also see the Bootloader Wiki Entry

3. Choose your **Region**

4. Choose your **Keyboard Layout**

5. Choose your **filesystem**. If you are not sure which one to choose, please take a look to [Filesystems](/installation/filesystem)

6. Choose your **Desktop Environment** you want to use, see [Desktop environments](/installation/desktop_environments)

7. Tick or Untick further packages for the netinstallation.

8. Check the **Summary Page** and proceed with the installation.

</Steps>

:::note
Secure boot must be disabled when installing CachyOS. To setup secure boot after install, see: [Secure Boot Setup](/configuration/secure_boot_setup)
:::

Calamares will then proceed to install CachyOS into your drive. The drivers will already be configured and working correctly out of the box with the help of our Hardware Detection. There is no need to install additional drivers after the installation unless needed for some less supported hardware.

As soon as Calamares has finished installing CachyOS, you'll get a prompt to reboot your system.

### ToDo

Add some pictures and further enhance the Wiki Page.
