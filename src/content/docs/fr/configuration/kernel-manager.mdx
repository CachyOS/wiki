CachyOS Kernel Manager
======================

The CachyOS Kernel Manager makes it simple to install and manage kernels from the repository. It also provides a comprehensive overview of all installed kernels.

Installing a Kernel from the Repository
---------------------------------------

To install a kernel, simply launch the CachyOS Kernel Manager application and choose the desired kernel from a list of available options.
Then, simply click the "execute" button to complete the installation.

Configuring and Building a Kernel
---------------------------------

The CachyOS Kernel Manager also makes it easy to configure and build custom kernels. To get started, simply open the application and click the "configure" button. Then, you can adjust various settings, such as the scheduler, performance governor, tick rate, and more. Once you have made your desired changes, simply click the "execute" button to begin building your custom kernel.

Available configuration options include:

*   Scheduler (sched-ext, BORE, ECHO, RC, RT)
*   Enable CachyOS config
*   Tweak Configuration via nconfig, menuconfig, xconfig, or gconfig
*   NUMA (disabled or enabled)
*   KBUILD CFLAGS (-O3 or -O2)
*   Performance governor as default
*   Enable BBR2
*   Tick rate (500Hz, 600Hz, 750Hz, 1000Hz)
*   Tickless (idle, periodic, full)
*   Disable MQ-Deadline I/O Scheduler
*   Disable Kyber I/O Scheduler
*   Enable/disable MG-LRU
*   Enable/disable DAMON
*   Enable/disable Speculative page fault
*   Apply automatic kernel optimization
*   Apply kernel optimization for specific CPU architectures
*   Build ZFS Module
*   Build NVIDIA Module
*   Enable LTO (Full, Thin, No)

Upon completion, the built kernel will automatically be installed and the package can be found in `$HOME/.cache/cachyos-km`.

Sched-ext GUI
-------------

The Kernel Manager also offers a GUI for managing and controlling the sched-ext schedulers on the **sched-ext scheduler config** button.
You can switch between different scx scheduler, enable the service and check which scheduler is currently running.
