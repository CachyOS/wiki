CachyOS can be installed using two types of installations: a GUI Installer and a CLI Installer.

## Validation

:::caution[WARNING]
Always take an extra step and verify the ISO's integrity to avoid any undesired issues at installation or while creating a bootable media.
:::

Here is how you can do it:

If you're currently on Windows:

<Steps>

1. If you downloaded the iso via SourceForge at the right of each file there is an exclamation point that contains both a SHA1 and a SHA256.
2. Open CMD or PowerShell as Administrator and navigate to the path where the ISO is stored.
3. Type the following command: certUtil -hashfile full_iso_name.iso SHA256

   e.g:
   ```powershell
   certUtil -hashfile cachyos-kde-linux-230813.iso SHA256
   ```

4. Compare certUtil hash with SourceForge file information, if they both match then you are ready to proceed.

</Steps>

Verification from any Linux distribution:

<Steps>

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the path where the ISO is stored
2. Type the following command: `sha256sum full_iso_name.iso`:

   e.g:
   ```sh
   sha256sum cachyos-kde-linux-230319.iso
   ```

3. Compare if the SourceForge SHA256 hash matches with the SHA256

</Steps>

## Verify ISO Image Authenticity

To verify the authenticity of the ISO file to be sure that the actual one has been released by the official CachyOS development team:

<Steps>

1. Import the GPG key for verifying the authenticity:

   ```shell
   gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key F3B607488DB35A47
   ```

2. Download the ISO file and its `.sig` signature file and run the following command (by replacing `full_iso_name.iso` with the actual ISO filename):
   ```shell
   gpg --verify full_iso_name.iso.sig full_iso_name.iso
   ```

   If you get a **Good signature** output, the ISO file is genuine:
   ```
   gpg: Signature made Mo 01 Apr 2024 14:13:30 CEST
   gpg:                using RSA key 882DCFE48E2051D48E2562ABF3B607488DB35A47
   gpg: Good signature from "CachyOS <admin@cachyos.org>" [unknown]
   gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
   gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
   Primary key fingerprint: 882D CFE4 8E20 51D4 8E25  62AB F3B6 0748 8DB3 5A47
   ```

</Steps>

:::danger
If the output does not return **Good signature** string or the key ID does not match, don't use the ISO image and check if you downloaded the image from a legitimate CachyOS source. It could suggest that your image has been tampered.
