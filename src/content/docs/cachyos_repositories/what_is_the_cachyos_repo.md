# Meet the CachyOS repositories
CachyOS repositories are one of the most unique aspects of CachyOS, setting it apart from other Arch-based distributions.
These repositories enable CachyOS to create performance-focused packages and exert more control over the package ecosystem compared to distros that solely rely on the Arch Linux repositories.

:::tip
CachyOS has a unique feature that allows users to receive text messages directly in the terminal. If the CachyOS team detects a dangerous state of the repository. You will be informed in the terminal before you execute the update. We already used that during a large Python 3.11 update in the past and prevented damage to users installation.
