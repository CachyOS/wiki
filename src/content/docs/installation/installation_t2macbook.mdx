## Installation

### General Information

CachyOS does provide out of the box T2 MacBook support and the required kernel patches are shipped in the default kernel.

The **WiFi Support** currently **is not implemented**, since this is a closed source firmware, which we are not allowed to distribute.
The installation will only work with LAN internet connection, after the installation you can download on firmware manually and install it to have proper WiFi Support.

You will find below a way to install the firmware after the installation.

### Proceeding with Installation

In the Wiki you can find how to flash and download the ISO.

After flashing the ISO Image just follow the On Root installation Page.
CachyOS does automatically configure your system with the CachyOS Hardware Detection, which does apply required boot parameters and other configuration.

### Installation of the Firmware

The firmware can be downloaded and fetched from another mirror, which is not hosted by us.

Run the following commands, after you have booted into the Installed System:

<Steps>

1. Fetch firmware package using one of the following utils:

    <TabItem label="using curl">

    ```sh
    curl https://mirror.funami.tech/arch-mact2/os/x86_64/apple-bcm-firmware-14.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst -o apple-bcm-firmware-14.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
    ```
    
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="using wget">
    
    ```sh
    wget https://mirror.funami.tech/arch-mact2/os/x86_64/apple-bcm-firmware-14.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
    ```
    > If you don't have `wget`, install it with `sudo pacman -S wget`
    
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Install firmware package
    ```sh
    sudo pacman -U apple-bcm-firmware-14.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
    ```

</Steps>

After that modprobe the firmware and reload the wifi driver:
```bash
sudo modprobe -r brcmfmac_wcc; sudo modprobe -r brcmfmac; sudo modprobe brcmfmac`
```

You are also able to extract the firmware from an ISPW File, see the T2 Wiki:
