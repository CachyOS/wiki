CachyOS does provide an Edition for handheld devices, like the Steam Deck, Rog Ally and Legion Go.
This Edition provides a SteamOS like experience with Game Mode Switching, Gaming Applications preinstalled and so on.

The Handheld Edition does utilize the LAVD Scheduler as default scheduler, which is an optimized for handheld devices.
This will provide better frametimes for Gaming.

The Handheld Edition uses `systemd-boot` as boot loader. Boot loader selection is not available in Handheld Edition,
as opposed to the default CachyOS ISO. This is intended to simplify the installation process.
