## Creating a Bootable CachyOS USB Drive

There are several tools and methods that you can use to create a bootable USB drive of CachyOS. The USB drive must have at least 8GB of available space.

### balenaEtcher

<Steps>

1. Download [balenaEtcher](<https://etcher.balena.io/>). balenaEtcher supports flashing an image of Linux, MacOS and Windows.
   If you downloaded the `.zip` file, extract it and execute the binary using the following commands:
      ```sh
      # Extract zip file:
      bsdtar xvf <zip file name>
      # cd to the new folder:
      cd balenaEtcher-linux-x64/
      # Execute balenaEtcher:
      ./balena-etcher
      ```
2. Plug in your USB drive to your system.
3. Select **Flash from file** and select the CachyOS ISO image file.
4. Click **Select target** and choose the label that matches your USB drive.
5. Press **Flash** to start the flashing process.

At the end of flash process you will get a **Flash Completed!** message. Close balenaEtcher and reboot your system to boot into CachyOS.
:::note
Be sure to have the USB drive **boot priority** over other drives in the BIOS/UEFI or boot it from your Boot Menu.

### Command Line Interface (Linux & MacOS)

<Steps>

1. Plug in your USB drive.
2. Detect the plugged USB drive using the following commands:
   ```sh
   # Linux
   # Your USB drive could be identified e.g: /dev/sda, by disk model and size.
   sudo fdisk -l
   
   # MacOS
   # USB drives are identified as "/dev/diskY" where "Y" could be 0,1 etc.
   diskutil list 
   ```
3. Copy the iso contents to your USB drive by running:
   ```sh
   # Replace <usbdrive> with the label of your drive.
   sudo dd bs=4M if=full_iso_name.iso of=/dev/<usbdrive> status=progress oflag=sync
   ```
</Steps>

- `dd` will now copy the contents of the ISO file over to your USB drive. Once it's done, you will be ready to use the USB drive as the CachyOS installation media. Reboot your system to boot into CachyOS.
:::note
Be sure to have the USB drive **boot priority** over other drives in the BIOS/UEFI or boot it from your Boot Menu.
