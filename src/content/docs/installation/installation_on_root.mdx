## Erase Disk

The "Erase Disk" Option in Calamares will wipe the selected disk and install then CachyOS to the target.

<Steps>

1. Boot into the ISO and click on **Launch Installer**.

2. Select a **Boot Manager** that suits your preferences. Check the [Boot Managers](/installation/boot_managers) section for more information.

3. Set your preferred **Language** and **Region/Timezone**.

4. Configure your **Keyboard Layout**.

5. Select **Erase Disk** and choose a [Filesystem](/installation/filesystem).

6. Pick the **Desktop Environment** you'd like to use, see [Desktop Environments](/installation/desktop_environments).

7. Select the specific packages you wish to install from the provided list, and deselect any that you do not require.

8. Setup your login credentials.

9. Review the installation summary on the Overview Page carefully. If all the settings look correct for you, proceed with the installation by clicking on ***Install Now***. Otherwise, go back and make any necessary changes.

## Dual Booting

After manual partitioning, there may be some additional setup needed to achieve a dual boot setup, particularly with `systemd-boot` and `GRUB`.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label='systemd-boot'>
        After doing a manual partition install, we need to copy over Windows's EFI binaries to Linux's EFI partition so the boot manager can
        recognize them.

        <Steps>
        1. Locate your Windows's EFI partition with `lsblk`

            ```sh
            ❯ lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT
            NAME        FSTYPE   SIZE MOUNTPOINT
            zram0               15.3G [SWAP]
            nvme0n1            476.9G
            ├─nvme0n1p1 vfat     100M
            ├─nvme0n1p2           16M
            ├─nvme0n1p3 ntfs   234.4G
            ├─nvme0n1p4 ntfs     830M
            ├─nvme0n1p5 vfat       2G /boot
            └─nvme0n1p6 btrfs  239.6G /var/tmp
            ```

            EFI partition are almost always partitioned as FAT32/vfat, and since `nvme0n1p1` doesn't have a Linux mountpoint, we can assume that partition
            is the Windows's EFI partition

        2. Mount Window's EFI partition temporarily

            ```sh
            ❯ sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/WinBoot # Replace `nvme0n1p1` with the partition of your Windows's EFI partition
            ```

        3. Copy the EFI binaries from Windows's EFI partition to Linux's EFI partition

            ```sh
            ❯ sudo cp -r /mnt/WinBoot/EFI/* /boot/EFI
            ```

        4. Unmount the previously mounted partition and Windows should show up in the boot menu on the next boot!

            ```sh
            ❯ sudo umount /mnt/WinBoot
            ```

        </Steps>
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label='GRUB'>
        GRUB can rely on `os-prober` to autodetect the Windows EFI partition and add it to the boot menu.

        <Steps>
        1. Install and run os-prober

            ```sh
            ❯ sudo pacman -S os-prober
            ❯ sudo os-prober
            ```

        2. Enable os-prober in GRUB's configuration file

            ```sh
            ❯ sudo micro /etc/default/grub
            # /etc/default/grub
            # Probing for other operating systems is disabled for security reasons. Read
            # documentation on GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER, if still want to enable this
            # functionality install os-prober and uncomment to detect and include other
            # operating systems.
            GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false

            ❯ sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
            ```

        3. Windows should be added into the boot menu now.

        </Steps>

## Common Issues

### Key was created in the future

:::note
This will be fixed in the September 2024 Release.
:::

The Installation fails with the following error log:
```text
gpg: key B1D99E8932D24EB5 was created 4785 seconds in the future (time warp or clock problem)
```

This problem is caused by an out-of-sync local time.
To be specific, the pacman master key was created when a wrong time set in your OS. This may cause the timestamp of the pacman master key is in the future after you correct the time on your OS (possibly by ntp).

After the installation failed, reboot again to the ISO and run the following commands:

```sh
sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/gnupg
timedatectl set-ntp true
```

Having done that, click on ***Launch Installer*** and proceed with the installation.
