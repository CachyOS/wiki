The following section will guide you through the steps to install CachyOS on VMware Workstation.

## Download the latest ISO

Download latest CachyOS ISO as described in [Downloading CachyOS](/cachyos_basic/download/).

## Creating a Virtual Machine

The following section assumes you have VMware Workstation installed on your system and set up correctly.

<Steps>

1. Open VMware Workstation and click on the `Create a New Virtual Machine` button.

5. Enter a name for the virtual machine and specify the location where you want to store the virtual machine files.
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import("~/assets/images/vmware-vm-name-and-location.png")} alt="Setting Virtual Machine Name and Location" />

6. Set the disk size to at least 32GB. You can allocate more if you have the space available. You can optionally choose to store the virtual disk as a single file or split into multiple files.
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import("~/assets/images/vmware-vm-disk-size.png")} alt="Setting Virtual Machine Disk Size" />

7. You will now see the summary of the virtual machine settings. Click on `Customize Hardware` to configure the hardware settings.
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import("~/assets/images/vmware-vm-summary.png")} alt="Virtual Machine Summary" />

8. In the hardware settings, you can configure the number of processors, memory size, network adapter, and other hardware settings. Make sure to allocate at least 4GB of memory to the virtual machine. You can increase or decrease it according to your setup. For the processor count, set it to the number of physical cores in your machine.

9. Optionally you can enable `Accelerate 3D graphics` under the `Display` tab for better performance, make sure to allocate enough video memory for the virtual machine.
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import("~/assets/images/vmware-vm-3d-acceleration.png")} alt="Enabling 3D Acceleration" />

10. Click on `Close` to save the hardware settings. You will now see the summary of the virtual machine settings. Uncheck the `Power on this virtual machine after creation` option and click on `Finish` to create the virtual machine.
    :::caution[WARNING]
    Don't forget to uncheck the `Power on this virtual machine after creation` option. We need to enable UEFI boot for CachyOS to boot correctly. If you powered on the virtual machine before enabling UEFI boot, you can power it off and then enable UEFI boot.

11. Now you will see the virtual machine created in VMware Workstation. Click on `Edit virtual machine settings` to configure the UEFI boot settings.
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import("~/assets/images/vmware-vm-edit-settings.png")} alt="Edit Virtual Machine Settings" />

12. In the virtual machine settings, go to the `Options` tab and select `UEFI` under the `Firmware type` section in the `Advanced` settings. Click on `Save` to save the settings.
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import("~/assets/images/vmware-vm-uefi-boot.png")} alt="Setting UEFI Boot" />

</Steps>

## Installing CachyOS

<Steps>

1. Start the virtual machine by clicking on the `Start up this guest operating system` button.
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import("~/assets/images/vmware-vm-start.png")} alt="Starting Virtual Machine" />

2. Now you can follow the steps in the [Installation Guide](/installation/installation_on_root/) to install CachyOS on the virtual machine.
