## 1\. Update your system:

### 1\. Updating System with Octopi:

Octopi is a graphical package manager for Arch-based distributions that provides a convenient way to manage packages and updates.
To update your system with Octopi, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Launch **Octopi** from the application menu
2. In the main window, click on the **Check updates** button (Top left), now next to it **System upgrade**
3. Octopi will now check for available updates and prompt you to either install them on Octopi itself or in a terminal.
4. To proceed with the update, click the **Apply** button.
5. Octopi will download and install the updates.
6. It is advised to reboot your computer after a big update (especially if the kernel version changes).

</Steps>

### 2\. Updating System with Pacman:

<Steps>

1. Open a terminal emulator (or press `ctrl + alt + t` - `mod + return` in Cachy's WMs)
2. Run the following command to update the system:

   ```sh
   sudo pacman -Syu
   ```

</Steps>

That's it! Now your system is up-to-date and ready for use.


## 2\. Enable Firewall protection:

To enable firewall protection, follow these steps:


<Tabs>

<TabItem label="1">

```bash
# Install the ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) package using Pacman:
sudo pacman -S ufw
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="2">


```bash
# Enable the firewall with this command:
sudo ufw enable
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="3">

By default, ufw allows all incoming and outgoing traffic, you can add specific rules to the firewall to block or allow specific connections.

```bash
# For example:
sudo ufw allow ssh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="4">

```bash
# To check the status of the firewall, use the following command:
sudo ufw status verbose
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
Be careful when configuring firewall rules, as improperly configured rules can lock you out of your own system.

## 3\. Install apps:

CachyOS comes pre-installed with many useful apps, but you may want to install additional ones to match your workflow.
Here are some popular apps you may consider installing:

*   GIMP (Image processor)
*   VLC (Media player)
*   Stacer (system monitor)
*   Skype, Telegram, Discord, Signal (messenger apps)
*   Steam (for gaming)
*   Spotify (Music)
*   MailSpring (email client)
*   Super Productivity (to-do list manager and Pomodoro timer)
*   Visual Studio Code (Code editor)
*   Blender (3D software)
*   Krita (Digital painting)

You can easily install these apps using the command line. For example:

```sh
paru -S vlc mailspring spotify gimp
```

If you get an error message, try using a different command or check the name of the app in the database.

## 4\. Enable global menu:
For some apps like Visual Studio Code, the global menu may not work or may be attached to the parent app instead of the panel.

```sh
# To enable global menu support, run the command and restart the app.
sudo pacman -S appmenu-gtk-module libdbusmenu-glib
```

## 5\. Set up Bluetooth headphones:
To auto-connect your headphones, follow the steps in the Arch wiki guide: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bluetooth\_headset#Headset\_via\_Bluez5/PulseAudio](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bluetooth_headset#Headset_via_Bluez5/PulseAudio). If Pulseaudio doesn't work, you may need to manually reconnect the headphones each time you restart your computer.
