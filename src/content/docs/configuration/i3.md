## FAQ

### How can i autostart a program? for example "set a wallpaper at start"

* i3 already includes an flexible autostart feature that allows you to execute any program or even commands

If you look at the end of our config file, you'll see some lines starting with exec and exec_always

For example:

```exec chromium```
This means that chromium is going to start in workspace 1 whenever you log in into your i3 session

* What differentiates exec from exec_always?

exec_always gives you the possibility to always execute a certain action even after i3wm got reloaded

* For more reference and information, checkout their i3's user guide
* <https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#exec>

### Do the multimedia keys work?

* Yes they do.
