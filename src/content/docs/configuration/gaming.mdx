# Gaming on CachyOS
Welcome to the world of gaming on CachyOS, a leading Arch-based distribution! This guide will help you get started with playing your favorite games on this operating system.

## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the fun stuff, it is essential to ensure that your graphics card drivers are installed and working properly. If your graphics card is not functioning optimally, you won't be able to play games properly.

## Essential Packages
To make things easier for you, CachyOS has grouped all the necessary packages for gaming into one meta package. This makes the installation process faster and easier. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
sudo pacman -S cachyos-gaming-meta
```

:::note
The `cachyos-gaming-meta` package installs the following [packages](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-PKGBUILDS/blob/master/cachyos-gaming-meta/PKGBUILD). *If you find that it is missing any packages, feel free to let the CachyOS team know.*

# Steam
For Steam users, playing games on CachyOS is a breeze! Simply open Steam and select the Proton option, and you're ready to enjoy your games.
:::note
Notebook users with NVIDIA GPUs should refer to the following guide: [NVIDIA PRIME Render Offload](https://wiki.cachyos.org/configuration/dual_gpu/)
:::

## Proton
Don't worry, Proton is very simple! In just a few clicks, you can have it set up and ready to use. Check out the screenshots below for a step-by-step guide.

You can use Proton to play your Windows games on Linux.
:::note
To check if your game is compatible with Linux, visit [proton-db](https://www.protondb.com/).
:::
CachyOS provides various Proton versions for improved performance, including `proton-cachyos`, `proton-ge-custom`, `proton-tkg-git`, and the official Proton versions `proton-experimental` and `proton`.

# Performance

CachyOS does provide a script to automatically switch to the performance governor profile, when starting the game.
The performance profile, will be set as long the game is running. If you close the game, then it will restore to the previous used profile.
Gamemode does something equal, but since we are using ananicy-cpp, gamemode should not be used on CachyOS.

Add following to the Launch Options in Steam:
```sh
game-performance %command%
```

# Bottles
Bottles is an application that allows you to easily manage Windows prefixes on your favorite Linux distributions. Bottles can also use different runners like Lutris and are all manageable within the application. Bottles offer the option of a gaming-orientated prefix. You can install dependencies, add EXE files, and use their one-click installers for gaming-related apps like EA App or Battle.net. To install Bottles, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
sudo pacman -S bottles
```
If you would like more information about Bottles, you can look through the [documentation](https://docs.usebottles.com/) for Bottles.

# Lutris
Lutris serves as a central hub for all your games on CachyOS. With Lutris, you can efficiently manage your games runners, including Wine, Proton, and emulators. You can even customize their parameters! To install Lutris, execute the following command in your terminal:
```sh
sudo pacman -S lutris
```
## Lutris guide

### 1. Set the proper Wine runner
Many games perform optimally with the Proton-GE runner, so it's advisable to configure it before installing anything else.
