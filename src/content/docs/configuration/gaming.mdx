# Gaming on CachyOS
Welcome to the world of gaming on CachyOS, a leading Arch-based distribution! This guide will help you get started with playing your favorite games on this operating system.

## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the fun stuff, it is essential to ensure that your graphics card drivers are installed and working properly. If your graphics card is not functioning optimally, you won't be able to play games properly.

## Essential Packages
To make things easier for you, CachyOS has grouped all the necessary packages for gaming into one meta package. This makes the installation process faster and easier. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
sudo pacman -S cachyos-gaming-meta
```

:::note
The `cachyos-gaming-meta` package installs the following [packages](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-PKGBUILDS/blob/master/cachyos-gaming-meta/PKGBUILD). *If you find that it is missing any packages, feel free to let the CachyOS team know.*
:::

## Steam
For Steam users, playing games on CachyOS is a breeze! Simply open Steam and select the Proton option, and you're ready to enjoy your games.
:::note
Notebook users with NVIDIA GPUs should refer to the following guide: [NVIDIA PRIME Render Offload](https://wiki.cachyos.org/configuration/dual_gpu/)
:::

## Proton
Don't worry, Proton is very simple! In just a few clicks, you can have it set up and ready to use. Check out the screenshots below for a step-by-step guide.

You can use Proton to play your Windows games on Linux.
:::note
To check if your game is compatible with Linux, visit [proton-db](https://www.protondb.com/).
:::
CachyOS provides various Proton versions for improved performance, including `proton-cachyos`, `proton-ge-custom`, `proton-tkg-git`, and the official Proton versions `proton-experimental` and `proton`.

## Performance

### Power Profile Switching on Demand
:::note
This behavior is slightly different with `intel_pstate`. On Intel, the governor remains at powersave but the
EPP/EPB values are set to performance.
:::

CachyOS provides a wrapper script [`game-performance`](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/bin/game-performance)
which uses `power-profiles-daemon` to temporarily switch the current power profile to `performance`.
The `performance` profile increases the system's power levels and changes the CPU governor to performance.

When this script is used to run a game, the system will be set to use the `performance` profile as long as the game is running.
The previously used power profile will be restored once the game is closed. [Feral's GameMode](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode)
has similar behavior but it should not be used as CachyOS ships with [`ananicy-cpp`](https://gitlab.com/ananicy-cpp/ananicy-cpp).

Add the following to the **Launch Options** in Steam:
```sh
game-performance %command%
```


### How to add game-performance to Lutris & Heroic Games Launcher & Bottles

Heroic Games Launcher:

"On the left panel, go to Settings > Game defaults. In the middle section, go to Advanced (next to OTHER). In the wrapper section, type 'game-performance' into the new-wrapper field without any extra arguments and click the plus sign."

Lutris:

"On the top right, open the hamburger menu > Preferences > Runners > Scroll down to Wine and click on the toolbox icon > Enable advanced mode on the top right > System options > Pre-launch script > either type or point to the following: /usr/bin/game-performance > Save changes." 

Bottles:

"Select an existing bottle > Below details next to the Run executable button, open the cogwheel > Type "game-performance" in the Launch Options field."

### Proton-CachyOS

Proton-CachyOS is based on proton-experimental and applies a bunch of patches on top of it:
- Wine-staging patches
- Wine Fullscreen FSR
- Reflex support for Wine and DXVK
- Wineserver gets LTO'd at compilation

In addition, proton-cachyos is compiled against native system libraries and compiler instructions, which can further improve performance

### Wine-CachyOS

This is a solution similar to proton-cachyos, but as standalone version, which can be used by Lutris, Heroic, Bottles and others or even as a system-wide wine solution.

## Bottles

Bottles is an application that allows you to easily manage Windows prefixes on your favorite Linux distributions.

Bottles can also make use of different runners like Lutris and are all manageable within the application. Bottles offers the option of a gaming-oriented prefix.
You can also install dependencies, add EXE files, and use their one-click installers for gaming-related apps like EA App or Battle.net.

To install Bottles, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
sudo pacman -S bottles
```
If you want to know more about it, check out their [documentation](https://docs.usebottles.com/).

## Lutris
Lutris serves as a central hub for all your games on CachyOS. With Lutris, you can efficiently manage your game runners, including Wine, Proton, and emulators. You can even customize their parameters! To install Lutris, execute the following command in your terminal:
```sh
sudo pacman -S lutris
```
## Lutris guide
Example on how to install the [Epic Games Store](https://lutris.net/games/epic-games-store/) inside Lutris on CachyOS.

### 1. Set the proper Wine runner
Many games perform optimally with the Proton-GE runner, so it's advisable to configure it before installing anything else.

### 4. Final words about Lutris
- You can launch games through Lutris simply by clicking the **Play button**.
- You can also launch a store using the **Play button** and then run games from within the store, just like you do on Windows.

### FAQ (WIP)

    Right click on the game icon > Configure > Game options > Arguments
- **Does game-performance work on Lutris?**
    
    Yes it does, 

### Games stores:
