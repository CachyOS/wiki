# What's hybrid graphics?

Hybrid graphics is a hardware configuration in which you have two graphics
cards that can work in tandem with each other. This approach is mainly found in
laptops where you have integrated graphics (iGPU) of your CPU, and discrete
graphics (dGPU). The main advantage is that integrated graphics should (but not
necessarily) only be used for low-profile tasks, such as surfing the Internet,
watching videos, etc. On the other hand, discrete graphics are used for high-performance
things like gaming, video editing, 3D modeling, and so on. Consequently, if two
GPUs share "big" and "small" tasks, then if we have only "small" tasks running
at the moment, we don't need to use our dGPU, so it can simply be disabled (as
if asleep), thereby significantly reducing power consumption. This way when our
dGPU is needed again (we run an application using it), it will wake up and
start working.

# What's PRIME Offload?

PRIME is a unifying technology for working with different sets of hybrid
graphics in Linux, like NVIDIA Optimus/AMD Dynamic Switchable Graphics. PRIME
Offload is an implementation of the idea of moving the execution of render from
one GPU to another in Linux. PRIME support in a closed NVIDIA driver actually
started only with the 435.17 driver. So if you are a user of the outdated 390xx
or even 340xx driver branches, PRIME Offload will not work for you. Note that we also
strongly discourage you from using outdated ways to handle hybrid graphics,
such as nvidia-xrun or Bumblebee. They are obsolete and unsupported (Bumblebee
has not been updated for over 8 years), run solely on hacks and have low
performance. At the same time the Nouveau driver supports PRIME Offload, which
can be an alternative for older dGPUs.

In CachyOS, **you don't need to configure anything to make PRIME Offload work**.
With the nvidia-utils package and cachyos-settings you already have everything
you need to use PRIME Offload.

Also, please avoid using tools like optimus-manager. They may seem quite handy
to you, but believe us, they can cause a lot of issues and you really don't
need them if your dGPU supports PRIME Offload and dynamic power management.

# How to use PRIME Offload?

To indicate PRIME that you want to use discrete graphics instead of integrated
graphics, you must specify a number of environment variables before running the
program:

```bash
__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia <program>
```

This set of variables looks very cumbersome and easy to forget, so you can
install the ``nvidia-prime`` package (``sudo pacman -S nvidia-prime``), which
contains script-alias for all these variables. Then running an application
using it will look like this:

```bash
prime-run <program>
```

Where ``<program>`` is the name of command that runs your application.

:::note
Some DX12 games have trouble choosing the dGPU even with `prime-run`
To workaround this, add the env var `VK_DRIVER_FILES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json`
before `prime-run` wrapper script.

## Graphical method

You might find launching all needed applications through the terminal using ``prime-run`` inconvenient.
Fortunately, some applications and desktop environments provide tools to control which GPU is used for specific applications.

### Lutris

To configure games to run with discrete graphics in Lutris you need to go to
settings (three strips in the bottom right corner of the window and
"Preferences" button). Next, go to *"Global Options"* -> *"Display"*. Here, you can select the GPU the game will run on.

<ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/lutris-prime.png')} />

### Steam

Steam doesn't have a specific setting to force a game to use discrete graphics. However, you can access the game's properties by clicking the gear icon before launching it. In the "Launch options" field, you can add the prime-run command or environment variables.
Example:

```bash
prime-run %command%
```

Be sure to add ``%command%`` after ``prime-run``. Remember that game options come after the placeholder,
while system environment variables or commands should precede it.

### KDE Plasma

Plasma has a very handy way to set up the startup of applications with discrete
graphics. However, this method only works if the switcheroo-control package and its corresponding service are installed on your system.

In a fresh installation of CachyOS, this package and service should already be
enabled by default via chwd.

```bash
sudo pacman -S switcheroo-control
sudo systemctl enable --now switcheroo-control
```

After having executed both commands, right click on the desktop entry you want on your desktop or in the
application menu then go to *"Properties"* -> *"Application"* -> *"Advanced Options"*.

You should have *"Run using dedicated graphics card"* checkbox checked.

<br />
<ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/plasma-prime.jpg')} />

:::note
Using switcheroo-control allows these checkboxes to work on all PRIME
configurations that don't even have NVIDIA dGPU, such as AMD-APU+AMD-Dedicated.
:::

### GNOME

On GNOME, you should also install switcheroo-control as shown above and
right-click on the application icon and select *"Run using discrete graphics"*.
But note that GNOME does not remember this choice for later, and the next time you
run the application from the icon, its going to run using integrated graphics instead of discrete.

### Cinnamon

Similar to Plasma, Cinnamon also allows you to select the GPU for specific applications. Right-click the application's desktop entry, go to Properties, and enable the relevant option.

<br />
<ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/cinnamon-prime.png')} />

If it's not available, make sure you have ``switcheroo-control`` installed and
its service enabled, because all desktop environments rely on it for this
functionality.

# Troubleshooting

## I: "I don't have a choice of Wayland session GDM"

S: This is a GDM upstream issue that intentionally blocks access to Wayland
session selection on the login screen, despite the fact that your integrated
GPU may support Wayland perfectly well.

To workaround this you need to disable the udev rules that are responsible for
this:

```bash
sudo ln -s /dev/null /etc/udev/rules.d/61-gdm.rules
```

## I: "My external monitor is very laggy on PRIME"

S: This is a known NVIDIA driver issue. You should have the latest NVIDIA
driver installed and use Wayland with a compositor that supports explicit sync.
For GNOME this has been fixed in version 46.2. For Plasma 6 it will probably be
fixed with 6.1 although some users report normal performance already on 6.0.
Other environments/window managers still have this issue, so you need to switch
to the latest version of GNOME or Plasma to fix it.
