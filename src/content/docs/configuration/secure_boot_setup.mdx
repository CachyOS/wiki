# sbctl

[`sbctl`](https://github.com/Foxboron/sbctl) is a a user-friendly secure boot key manager capable of setting up secure boot,
offers key management capabilities and keeps track of files that needs to be signed in the boot chain.

## Installing sbctl

```bash
❯ sudo pacman -S sbctl
```

## Pre-setup

### GRUB Bootloader

If you are using GRUB, run the following command to enable secure boot support on GRUB using CA Keys.

```bash
❯ sudo grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=cachyos --modules="tpm" --disable-shim-lock
```

:::note
Loading unnecessary modules in your bootloader has the potential to present a security risk.
Only run this command if you actually need secure boot.
:::

### Entering Setup Mode in UEFI
Firstly, we need to go to firmware settings and set secure boot mode to "Setup Mode". You can reboot from an
already running system to firmware settings with following command.

```bash
❯ systemctl reboot --firmware-setup
```

This is how the BIOS looks like on a Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro. Reset to setup mode or restore factory keys and reboot back
to the system

## Setting Up sbctl

```bash
❯ sudo sbctl status # If setup mode is enabled we can proceed to the next step
Installed:      ✘ sbctl is not installed
Setup Mode:     ✘ Enabled
Secure Boot     ✘ Disabled

❯ sudo sbctl create-keys # Create your custom secure boot keys
Created Owner UUID a9fbbdb7-a05f-48d5-b63a-08c5df45ee70
Creating secure boot keys...✔
Secure boot keys created!

❯ sudo sbctl enroll-keys -m # Enroll your keys with Microsoft's keys
Enrolling keys to EFI variables...✔
Enrolled keys to the EFI variables!

❯ sudo sbctl status
# sbctl should now be installed and we can proceed to signing the kernel images and boot loader
Installed:      ✔ sbctl is installed
Owner GUID:     a9fbbdb7-a05f-48d5-b63a-08c5df45ee70
Setup Mode:     ✔ Disabled
Secure Boot     ✘ Disabled
Vendor Keys:    microsoft
```

## Signing the Kernel Image and Boot Loader

CachyOS provides a script [`sbctl-batch-sign`](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/bin/sbctl-batch-sign)
that takes the list of files needed to be signed from `sudo sbctl verify` and signs them all.

```bash
❯ sudo sbctl verify
Verifying file database and EFI images in /boot...
✘ /boot/1c4b5246eef05ac3bc87339323cd5101/6.10.0-cn4.0.fc40.x86_64/linux is not signed
✘ /boot/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI is not signed
✘ /boot/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi is not signed
✘ /boot/1c4b5246eef05ac3bc87339323cd5101/0-rescue/linux is not signed
✘ /boot/1c4b5246eef05ac3bc87339323cd5101/6.10.0-cn3.0.fc40.x86_64/linux is not signed

❯ sudo sbctl-batch-sign

❯ sudo sbctl verify
Verifying file database and EFI images in /boot...
✔ /boot/1c4b5246eef05ac3bc87339323cd5101/6.10.0-cn4.0.fc40.x86_64/linux is signed
✔ /boot/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI is signed
✔ /boot/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi is signed
✔ /boot/1c4b5246eef05ac3bc87339323cd5101/0-rescue/linux is signed
✔ /boot/1c4b5246eef05ac3bc87339323cd5101/6.10.0-cn3.0.fc40.x86_64/linux is signed
```

:::note
In some cases with rEFInd, the kernel image might not detected when running `sudo sbctl verify`.
To sign the kernel image, you can just do `sudo sbctl sign -s /boot/vmlinuz-linux-cachyos`.
The file name of the kernel image varies between kernel versions and there could be more than one if you have
multiple kernel versions installed.
:::

Now that all the files are signed, we can reboot back to UEFI settings and enable secure boot.
Note that this is a one-time process as signing files with `-s` flag will save those files to `sbctl`'s database.
`sbctl` ships with a [pacman hook](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman_hook) meaning it will automatically
sign all new files upon a kernel or boot loader update.

## Verify that Secure Boot is Enabled

To check that secure boot is indeed enabled. You can run one of the following commands

```bash
❯ sudo sbctl status
Installed:      ✓ sbctl is installed
Owner GUID:     a9fbbdb7-a05f-48d5-b63a-08c5df45ee70
Setup Mode:     ✓ Disabled
Secure Boot:    ✓ Enabled
Vendor Keys:    microsoft

❯ bootctl
System:
      Firmware: UEFI 2.80 (INSYDE Corp. 28724.16435)
 Firmware Arch: x64
   Secure Boot: enabled (user)
  TPM2 Support: yes
  Measured UKI: no
  Boot into FW: supported
```

## Migration to newer sbctl version

Starting from sbctl `0.15`, sbctl files have been moved from `/usr/share/secureboot` to `/var/lib/sbctl`. Due to this change,
a migration is necessary if users are using sbctl before `0.15`.
You might need to clean `/var/lib/sbctl` first, in case you get a warning.

```bash
❯ sudo sbctl setup --migrate
```

sbctl provides a migration command to move all files from the old location to the new one.

:::note
This section isn't necessary for new sbctl users.
