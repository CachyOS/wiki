CachyOS Kernel Manager
======================

The CachyOS Kernel Manager makes it simple to install and manage kernels from the repository. It also provides a comprehensive overview of all installed kernels.

Installing a Kernel from the Repository
---------------------------------------

To install a kernel, simply launch the CachyOS Kernel Manager application and choose the desired kernel from a list of available options.
Then, simply click the "execute" button to complete the installation.

Configuring and Building a Kernel
---------------------------------

The CachyOS Kernel Manager also makes it easy to configure and build custom kernels. To get started, simply open the application and click the "configure" button. Then, you can adjust various settings, such as the scheduler, performance governor, tick rate, and more. Once you have made your desired changes, simply click the "execute" button to begin building your custom kernel.

Available configuration options include:

* Custom package name
* Scheduler (sched-ext, BORE, ECHO, RC, RT)
* Enable CachyOS config
* Tweak Configuration via nconfig, menuconfig, xconfig, or gconfig
* Enable/Disable NUMA
* Enable/Disable Modprobed-db 
* KBUILD CFLAGS (-O3 or -O2)
* Performance governor as default
* Enable BBR3
* Tick rate selection (100Hz, 250Hz, 300Hz, 500Hz, 600Hz, 750Hz, 1000Hz)
* Tickless mode (idle, periodic, full)
* Preemption (Full, Voluntary or Server)
* Transparent Hugepages (Always or Madvise) 
* Enable/Disable DAMON
* Enable/Disable Automatic CPU arch detection
* Apply kernel optimization for specific CPU architectures
* Enable LTO (Full, Thin, No)
* Build ZFS Module
* Build NVIDIA Closed Module
* Build NVIDIA Open Module
* Include vmlinux with debug information/symbols
* Load/Save Kernel Manager config preset
* Kernel Patches Management (Remote and Local support)

Once the kernel is built, it will be installed automatically. You can find the package in `$HOME/.cache/cachyos-km`.

Sched-ext GUI
-------------

The Kernel Manager also offers a GUI for managing and controlling the sched-ext schedulers on the **sched-ext scheduler config** button.
You can switch between the different scx schedulers, enable the service and check which scheduler is currently running.
