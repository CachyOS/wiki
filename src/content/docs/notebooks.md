# NVIDIA PRIME Render Offload
## The official way from NVIDIA
Append these environment variables before running the program
```bash
__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia <program>
```
### Steam
```bash
__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia %command%
```
:::tip
Please read the [docs from NVIDIA](https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/435.17/README/primerenderoffload.html) if you are wondering why we added`__VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only`
:::

## Wrapper script
Arch Linux provides a package called [`nvidia-prime`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/nvidia-prime/) that helps you set the environment variables above when you run a program, to use it simply execute the following:

### Installation of the Wrapper script
```bash
sudo pacman -S nvidia-prime
```

You can use `prime-run` now.
```bash
prime-run <program>
```

### GNOME
As of GNOME 3.38 and later, you can select *"Run with Discrete Graphics"* from the context menu when you right-click on an application.


# Optimus Manager (legacy)
:::caution[WARNING]
We don't recommend using **Optimus Manager**, as it may result in significant issues with NVIDIA GPUs. The creator of Optimus Manager no longer feels confident in maintaining it, as mentioned in this GitHub issue: https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager/issues/543

**We recommend utilizing NVIDIA PRIME Render Offload!**

**Optimus Manager is still available as legacy support** for users who genuinely require it, especially in cases where NVIDIA PRIME Render Offload cannot fulfill their needs.
:::

**Clever tool for easy switching between a laptop's integrated GPU and the discrete one.**

Modern laptops have two graphics cards, especially if we talk about gaming laptops.
**iGPU** - integrated GPU, longer battery life, and lower performance.
**dGPU** - discrete GPU, higher performance, but it would drain more battery, highly recommended for gaming, rendering, video encoding, NVENC among other demanding tasks.

Windows automatically switches between the iGPU and dGPU depending on the usage.
Here is a guide on how to set up the same for CachyOS, especially if you plan to use it for gaming or streaming, 3D development, etc.

Tested on a laptop with an Intel CPU and a NVIDIA GPU, but since release 1.4 Optimus Manager also has support for AMD CPUs.

## Preparing iGPU and dGPU for the Linux Kernel
Let's start by configuring **mkinitcpio** which loads various kernel modules.

### Intel iGPU
Add `i915 intel_agp nvidia` to the MODULES section in `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`:
```bash
MODULES=(i915 intel_agp nvidia)
```
> The `intel_agp` module may cause issues with hibernation on some systems, see https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=262043. Try omitting the module if you encounter issues.

### AMD iGPU
#### with [AMDGPU driver](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AMDGPU)
Add `amdgpu nvidia` to the MODULES section in `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`:
```bash
MODULES=(amdgpu nvidia)
```
<!---
TODO: is the old radeon really support PRIME?
-->
#### with [radeon driver](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ATI)
Add `radeon nvidia` to the MODULES section in `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`:
```bash
MODULES=(radeon nvidia)
```

## Enable "Direct Rendering Manager" (DRM KMS)
To enable DRM we need to add the necessary kernel parameter in the bootloader, each bootloader has a different way to do that.

:::note
DRM KMS is already enabled by default in CachyOS as of cachyos-settings v23
:::

### Using GRUB

Add `nvidia-drm.modeset=1` to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in `/etc/default/grub`, it'll look something like this:

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="nvidia-drm.modeset=1 ..."
```

Now you must use these two commands to save the modification into all the installed kernels and update GRUB.

```sh
# run the following commands
sudo mkinitcpio -P
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

### Using systemd-boot
(under development)

## Installing Optimus Manager

Installing optimus-manager & Optimus-manager-qt (a system tray for optimus-manager)
```sh
sudo pacman -S optimus-manager optimus-manager-qt
```

The last step, we need to enable and start the service for Optimus manager
```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now optimus-manager.service
```

You can now reboot, after rebooting, you will have a fully working Optimus Manager, which you can **find the icon on the bottom right corner of the taskbar.**

Congrats! You are now done with the setup.

# Optional configuration
:::note
With the CachyOS-Settings v27 update, the settings related to **PCI-Express Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management** are already enabled by default.
:::

## Fully power down the GPU when not in use
:::note
This feature is only supported on laptops with Turing GPUs (RTX 20xx/GTX 16xx) and above, and Intel Coffee Lake CPUs (8th gen) and above.
:::

**PCI-Express Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management**
Add these rules into `/etc/udev/rules.d/80-nvidia-pm.rules`

```bash
# Load and unload nvidia-modeset module
ACTION=="add", DEVPATH=="/bus/pci/drivers/nvidia", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe nvidia-modeset"
ACTION=="remove", DEVPATH=="/bus/pci/drivers/nvidia", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe -r nvidia-modeset"

# Load and unload nvidia-drm module
ACTION=="add", DEVPATH=="/bus/pci/drivers/nvidia", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe nvidia-drm"
ACTION=="remove", DEVPATH=="/bus/pci/drivers/nvidia", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe -r nvidia-drm"

# Load and unload nvidia-uvm module
ACTION=="add", DEVPATH=="/bus/pci/drivers/nvidia", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe nvidia-uvm"
ACTION=="remove", DEVPATH=="/bus/pci/drivers/nvidia", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe -r nvidia-uvm"

# Enable runtime PM for NVIDIA VGA/3D controller devices on driver bind
ACTION=="bind", SUBSYSTEM=="pci", DRIVERS=="nvidia", ATTR{vendor}=="0x10de", ATTR{class}=="0x03[0-9]*", TEST=="power/control", ATTR{power/control}="auto"

# Disable runtime PM for NVIDIA VGA/3D controller devices on driver unbind
ACTION=="unbind", SUBSYSTEM=="pci", DRIVERS=="nvidia", ATTR{vendor}=="0x10de", ATTR{class}=="0x03[0-9]*", TEST=="power/control", ATTR{power/control}="on"
```
> The top three `ACTION=="add"` rules are not needed when running Linux kernel `5.5` and newer, see https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/530.30.02/README/dynamicpowermanagement.html.

Next add the following text to `/etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf`
```
options nvidia "NVreg_DynamicPowerManagement=0x02"
```

To apply these changes right now:
```sh
sudo udevadm control --reload
sudo udevadm trigger
```
Now you need to edit optimus-manager's configuration file to enable **(RTD3) Power Management** by adding `dynamic_power_management=fine` to `/etc/optimus-manager/optimus-manager.conf`

## Using nvidia-persistenced
Enable nvidia-persistenced.service to avoid the kernel tearing down the device state whenever the NVIDIA device resources are no longer in use.
```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now nvidia-persistenced.service
```
And finally, reboot your system.
Your laptop's hybrid mode should now work as it does on Windows!
