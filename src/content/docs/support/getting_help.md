title: Getting Help
---

CachyOS has a very friendly and active community that can help you if you encounter an issue. You can
reach out for help through one of the services we support.

:::note
We have a webhook that bridges messages from Discord, Matrix and Telegram to each other.
This means that with only one of these services, you can communicate to the whole CachyOS community.

## Discord
Join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/cachyos-862292009423470592) to get support or hang out with the CachyOS community!

Upon joining the server, you must wait for 10 minutes before you can verify yourself in `#verify` channel.
After verifying yourself, you can head over to the `#support` channel for help or join the various discussions or banter
over in `#general` and `#offtopic`.

## CachyOS Forums
Since May 04 2024, we have provided a forum over on [https://discuss.cachyos.org/](https://discuss.cachyos.org/) as a more centralized
place for getting announcements on CachyOS or bug reports/issues in CachyOS.

You have to first make an account and login before being able to create a forum post.
