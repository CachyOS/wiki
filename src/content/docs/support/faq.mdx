Here are some of the common questions. We recommend that users read this, especially those using CachyOS or Arch-based distributions.

## Installation FAQ

### Why is KDE Plasma the only available option in the live environment?

KDE Plasma can be considered as our "flagship" desktop environment, therefore it gets the most maintenance. Other ISOs
were maintained in a half-ass state, if at all so we decided to deprecate them so that we can focus our efforts to deliver
the best user experience.

We recommend installing CachyOS in a VM for testing out different desktop environments and window managers as the live ISO is only
used for installation and recovering a broken install via [cachy-chroot](https://github.com/CachyOS/cachy-chroot).
