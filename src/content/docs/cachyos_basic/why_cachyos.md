CachyOS offers a polished Arch experience, complete with a user-friendly installer, pre-configured desktops, performance optimizations without compromising the user experience.

Besides performance changes, we provide a ready to go setup for NVIDIA GPUs, ZFS which is built into some of our kernels and miscellaneous tools

## Optimized Packages and Repositories
CachyOS maintains its own repositories with optimized packages, especially for your hardware.
There are x86-64-v3, x86-64-v4 and Zen4 optimized repositories that exists to enhance your experience by
reducing latency, improving performance, applying special fixes, etc.

Check out [this](/cachyos_repositories/what_are_the_cachyos_repo) page for a more detailed explanation of the optimized repositories that we provide.

## Advanced CPU Scheduler Support
Firstly let's understand what a CPU scheduler is. In the Linux kernel, the CPU scheduler is a crucial component
that manages how tasks (or processes) are executed on the system. It decides which task should run next,
ensuring efficient use of system resources to allow multiple tasks to run simultaneously.

By default CachyOS provides BORE (Burst-Oriented Response Enhancer) scheduler in the default kernel,
an extended version of EEVDF + sched-ext, a framework to load userspace schedulers. We also provide other kernels with individual versions of EEVDF and the sched-ext framework separately. You can choose your preferred kernel variant and its corresponding scheduler using the kernel manager bundled with the installation.

For more information about the kernels that we offer, check out the [variants](/kernel/kernel#variants) page.

## Customizable Installation Process
Start your CachyOS journey by booting from the [bootable USB](/installation/installation_prepare/#creating-a-bootable-cachyos-usb-drive) that you created,
Youâ€™ll be welcomed by our Hello program, a helpful introduction to CachyOS. Our customized Calamares installer provides a wide range of possibilities.
We offer a variety of [desktop environments](/installation/desktop_environments/), [boot managers](/installation/boot_managers/)
and [kernels](/kernel/kernel#variants) to choose from.
You can choose what you need and deselect whatever you don't. Your system, your choices.

:::caution[WARNING]
Selecting multiple desktop environments is not allowed due to possible breakage. For example, KDE and GNOME. We recommend choosing a single desktop environment to avoid an installation error.

## User Friendly OS
By default, we provide our own applications, such as CachyOS Hello or CachyOS Package Installer
among others to simplify and enhance your Linux experience. For example, CachyOS Hello provides options to update your system, enable services and rank the mirrors. Package Installer will help you to install packages.
