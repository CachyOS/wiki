##  Installing a Kernel with sched-ext support

CachyOS provides kernels, which have OOB support for the sched-ext framework.
Following kernels are supported:
- linux-cachyos (default kernel)
- linux-cachyos-sched-ext (latest Stable release)
- linux-cachyos-sched-ext-debug (This is thought for developers to develop and work on sched-ext)
- linux-cachyos-rc (latest testing release with the latest features)

You can simply check with following command, if your kernel supports sched-ext:
```bash
‚ùØ zcat /proc/config.gz | grep SCHED_CLASS_EXT
CONFIG_SCHED_CLASS_EXT=y
```

## Starting and using the scx schedulers

You can find the schedulers in the `scx-scheds` or `scx-scheds-git` package. 
Simply run following command to install the package:
```sh
sudo pacman -Sy scx-scheds
```

The `scx-scheds-git` package could have issues, when using it with the stable kernel due API or Feature changes. So the `scx-scheds-git` package should be as best used, together with the `linux-cachyos-rc` kernel.

### Starting the Scheduler

The scheduler can be simply started in the terminal with following command:
```sh
sudo scx_rusty
```

This will launch the rusty scheduler and detach the default scheduler.

To stop the scheduler, you simply run CTRL + C and the scheduler will be stopped and the default kernel scheduler will be used again.

### Systemd Service

The scx packages provides also a systemd service. This services can be configured `/etc/default/scx`. 
You can change here the scheduler you want to use for the systemd service and also pass options to it.
As default the rusty scheduler is set. If you want to change the used scheduler by the service simply change the `SCX_SCHEDULER=scx_rusty` to `SCX_SCHEDULER=scx_lavd`.

Now you can start/enable/stop the scheduler as any other systemd service.

#### Use the scx scheduler as default and enable directly at the boot

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now scx
```

#### Start the scheduler only once via the systemd service

```sh
sudo systemctl start scx
```

#### Stop the scx scheduler via systemd service

```sh
sudo systemctl stop scx
```

## Suggestion for Schedulers

Since there are really many example scheduler, we want to give a little suggestion about the scheduler:
- **scx_rusty** - a good global scheduler, which is very interactive and stress resistant. Can be for any workload
- **scx_lavd** - Scheduler developed for Gaming and mainly for handhelds. This Scheduler has currently no Topology Aware (For example when the CPU has 2 CXX, like a 7950X)
- **scx_rustland** - Scheduler with userspace scheduling. Can handle heavy workloads good, but does have overhead due userspace scheduling

## Benchmarking Schedulers

In order to benchmark shedulers for various options we suggest use mini-benchmarker tool that is avaible in our repositories.To install mini-benchmarker:
#### Install mini-benchmarker
```sh
sudo pacman -Sy mini-benchmarker
```
#### How to benchmark
When you have installed mini-benchmarker to start benchmark you should do:
```sh
mini-benchmarker /bench
```
:::caution[WARNING]
"bench" is a folder where results (and tools) located. You can use any other name.
:::
:::caution[WARNING]
If you want to make 2 (or more) benchmarks just run mini-benchmarker in the same folder.
Also if there is 2 (or more) benchmark results you might want to edit kernel name in text files of result folder to see 2 (or more) graphs for each bench.
We suggest to add in the end of kernel line name of schedule that was used in benchmark.
:::
After benchmark completed job you can find results (in directory that you used) and check results.

#### Make a graph (Optional)
If you want to make image with result of benchmark you can use tool called mini-benchmark-scraper. Inorder to use it firstly you should download and chmod (allow admin rights) and run:
```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julmajustus/mini-benchmark-scraper/main/benchmark_scraper.py
chmod +x benchmark_scraper.py
python benchmark_scraper.py
```
And you made it. You can check .png files with result of benchmark(s).
