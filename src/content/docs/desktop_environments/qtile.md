## FAQ

### Why is the volume widget showing an error or it's stuck at 0%?

* Sometimes this is due to Qtile volume widget not being able to detect your default Output Device, you can take a look in the wiki for more information.
* <https://docs.qtile.org/en/latest/manual/ref/widgets.html#pulsevolume>

### Is there a autostart.sh script?

* Its located in scripts/ from Qtile folder

### Does Qtile's bar interacts with the mouse?

* It does, for example if you scroll on the tiny dots which are your workspaces (Active,Inactive,Empty etc) you'll switch to the Left or Right or even click in one of them.
* Another example is the layout (columns by default), clicking on it allows you to switch between the available layouts
* CPU and RAM usage by clicking it's going to open Btop (TUI System Monitor)
* Increase/Lower/Mute/ by interacting on the volume widget
